# seed
An Applesoft game for the Apple II

# installation
Use the *.dsk or paste the seed.bas in your emulator.

If you have real Apple II (envy you) you already know better than me how to load dsk or bas. You can always type the program in like it's 1984, but the source is a bit hard to type it 

# usage
Use arrow keys or numbers to select items from the in-game menus. Make sure you have pen and paper handy.
